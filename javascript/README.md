# Javascript

JavaScript is a versatile and widely-used programming language primarily designed for creating dynamic and interactive content on the web. Initially developed for client-side scripting within web browsers, JavaScript has evolved to become a full-stack language, allowing developers to build both frontend and backend components of web applications.

    * Right click and choose "Inspect"
    * Go to the console
    * Copy + paste the Javascript where appropriate
    * Press enter to run
3. Node (Best for people who only want to learn Javascript) 
    * Install the program "node"
